libcsd
======

Custom base library for C++20 based on libc, which does not use the STL
apart from the new/delete operators. For real world applications, you
should use the STL instead. This project is mostly for making my own
C++ code clean, with better names and more descriptive method names.

For example, instead of using the std::string type which is buried under
a milion layers of unreadable template code, you can simply:

	#include <libcsd/print.h>
	#include <libcsd/str.h>

	str welcome = "hello world!";

	welcome.replace('h', 'H').replace('w', 'W');
	println(welcome);

Because this library is based on concepts instead of std::enable_if hell,
the library code itself is clean and is easily modifiable.


Use
---

After installing the static library, you can link with it using:

	$ c++ -std=c++2a file.cc /usr/local/lib/libcsd.a

If it fails to find the headers, you may add `-I/usr/local/include`.


Install
-------

Requirements:
	- GCC or Clang C++ compiler, that can handle C++20
	- meson
	- ninja

This command will compile & install the library and headers into /usr/local:

	# ./install.sh


Library
-------

The generic symbols in the library are in the global namespace, and only the
implementation details can be found in the csd:: namespace. Note that there is
nothing against using the symbols in the csd:: namespace, as many of them are
only there to not clutter the global namespace, and are not actually details.

Global symbols exposed by the library:
	box<T>                  heap allocated T
	list<T>                 dynamically resized array
	maybe<T>                possibly a value, used as a return type
	routine<R(Args...)>     thin wrapper around a function
	str                     basic string
	bytes                   contiguous array of raw bytes
	print()                 print n things
	println()               print n things, followed by a newline

All types are implemented using POSIX libc without any STL symbols or includes
apart from one detail type, being csd::__arc, which is a atomic reference
counter implemented using std::atomic.

For more information about the types, see the comment blocks above their
declarations in their respective header files.
