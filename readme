libmint
-------

Custom base library for C++20 based on libc, which does not use the STL
apart from the new/delete operators. For real world applications, you
should use the STL instead. This project is mostly for making my own
C++ code clean, with better names and more descriptive method names.

For example, instead of using the std::string type which is buried under
a milion layers of unreadable template code, you can simply:

	str welcome = "hello world!";

	welcome.replace('h', 'H').replace('w', 'W');
	println(welcome);

Because this library is based on concepts instead of std::enable_if hell,
the library code itself is clean and is easily modifiable.
